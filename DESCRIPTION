Description: "Seahtrue: Analysis and Visualization of Seahorse Wave Data for OCR and ECAR Calculations"
            The Seahtrue package provides functionalities for both the analysis and visualization of
            Seahorse Wave data. It allows loading Seahorse Excel files generated by the Agilent 
            Wave software and extracting useful information relevant to the end user. The package
            enables calculations such as Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) and Extracellular 
            Acidification Rate (ECAR) for both the Wave method and an alternative Seahtrue method. 
            These calculations are performed on data from cell-containing wells as well as background wells.
            The Seahtrue package offers visualization capabilities to plot the relevant information, 
            allowing users to gain insights from the data. By leveraging Seahtrue, users can streamline 
            their Seahorse Wave data analysis tasks, improve efficiency, and obtain meaningful results with ease.
